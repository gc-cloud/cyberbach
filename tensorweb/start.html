<h1>Tensor Flow Music</h1>

<body>
<p>
This repository contains the code to host a web app that takes .midi files as inputs and generates a new .midi file using recurrent neural networks in tensorflow.
</p>
<p>
This solution is heavily based on Dab Shiebler's Musical TensorFlow article for generating long sequences of polyphonic music by using an RNN_RBM in TensorFlow.
</p>
<p>
The original solution was upgraded to work with Tensorflow 1.1 accept user provided midi files, automatically generate new music and play the new music online. See log of major changes below for changes to core code from Dab Shiebler's
